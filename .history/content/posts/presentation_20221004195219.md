## Introduction

***Date:** 27 Jun 13*

We were tasked with presenting the work of the Hack team as well as an introduction to DevOps practices and technologies more generally to a non technical audience.
The Audience was a portfolio team whose interest included are work but who didn't necessarily have any technical background.

### How did we get the ticket?

The portfolio team had been conducting a series of meetings where a representative from another team presented the work of their team and explained in laymans terms how they worked and what it was that they were concerned with.
For example, the week before our presentation, a member of the developer team demonstrated jenkins pipelines.
When our team was approached, it was decided by the lead that this would be an ideal opportunity for me and a fellow apprentice to demionstrate what we had leaarnt as well as consolidating our knowledge of the team and how it fit into the organisation as a whole.

## What was the situation?

It was deemed that the portfolio teams knowledge of modern DevOps practioces and philosophy as well as common technologies and thier uses was very lacking.
It was impressed upon us that not only should we highlight our day to day work but also give some insight into the motivations behind the development of the DevOps philsophy and further relevant context.

## The Structure of the Presentation

From the beginning I suggested that it might be useful to divide our presentation into two parts.
As DevOps practices are largely the result of and reaction to prior working practices in manging IT infrastructure and Ops, I reasoned that our introduction to these practices would not make sense without the added context of what they were replacing.

I also thought once we had introduced some context the second half should speak about what DevOps included.
We didn't want to just read a list of technologies and end it there, so I suggested we use mock user stories.

The delivery manager on our team advised us to minimise the technical jargon and explain the terms explicitly.

At the end we recieved good feedback on the content, narrative as well as the delivery of the presentation.
