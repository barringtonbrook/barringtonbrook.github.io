## Introduction

***Date:** 27 Jul 22*

We were tasked with presenting the work of the Hack team as well as an introduction to DevOps practices and technologies more generally to a non technical audience.

The Audience was a portfolio team whose interest included are work but who didn't necessarily have any technical background.

### How did we get the ticket?

The portfolio team had been conducting a series of meetings where a representative from another team presented the work of their team and explained in laymans terms how they worked and what it was that they were concerned with.
For example, the week before our presentation, a member of the developer team demonstrated jenkins pipelines.
When our team was approached, it was decided by the lead that this would be an ideal opportunity for me and a fellow apprentice to demionstrate what we had leaarnt as well as consolidating our knowledge of the team and how it fit into the organisation as a whole.

### What was the situation?

It was deemed that the portfolio teams knowledge of modern DevOps practices and philosophy as well as common technologies and thier uses was very lacking.
It was impressed upon us that not only should we highlight our day to day work but also give some insight into the motivations behind the development of the DevOps philsophy and further relevant context.

### The team

The work was divided between myself and another apprentice. [^b1]

It was decided that a powerpoint presentation would be the most effective method to get our point across.
I suggested at the beginning of the planning session that rather than giving distracting second information it would be best if the powerpoint provided a skeleton for what we saying. That way, the audience would be able follow the structure of our talk and anticipate what they were about to hear and infer the correct context.

## The structure of the presentation

From the beginning I suggested that it might be useful to divide our presentation into two parts.
As DevOps practices are largely the result of and reaction to prior working practices in manging IT infrastructure and Ops, I reasoned that our introduction to these practices would not make sense without the added context of what they were replacing.

I also thought once we had introduced some context the second half should speak about what DevOps included.
We didn't want to just read a list of technologies and end it there, so I suggested we use mock user stories such as the one below.

## Feedback

After we had a rough idea of the layout of the presentation we approached a number of other staff members within and without the team to get feedback from a range of perspectives.  [^k19]

First we delivered the presentation to a non-technical delivery manager on our team.
She advised us to minimise the technical jargon and explain the terms explicitly.
She explained that analogies might be helpful as well.

So in the presentation, I suggested where we have one slide where I roughly explain the meaning of certain terms using one or two sentences to give the audience to grab onto before more in depth explanations.
This was to great effect later on as people remarked how easy the presentation was to follow and how it illuminated aspects of DevOps that they had never fully understood.

## Conclusion

At the end we recieved good feedback on the content, narrative as well as the delivery of the presentation.

[^s1]: Here is an example of **[S1](/tags/s1)** in that I communicated with non-technical and semi-technical people about the work we do.
[^b1]: The collaboration between myself with the other apprentice as well as the various people we consulted on different aspects of the presentation demonstrate **[B1](/tags/b1)**.
[^k19]: **[K19](/tags/k19)** is demonstrated here.
