## Introduction

We were tasked with presenting the work of the Hack team as well as an introduction to DevOps practices and technologies more generally to a non technical audience.
The Audience was a portfolio team whose interest included are work but who didn't necessarily have any technical background.

## The Structure of the Presentation

From the beginning I suggested that it might be useful to divide our presentation into two parts.
As DevOps practices are largely the result of and reaction to prior working practices in manging IT infrastructure and Ops, I reasoned that our introduction to these practices would not make sense without the added context of what they were replacing.

I also thought once we had introduced some context the second half should speak about what DevOps included.
We didn't want to just read a list of technologies and end it there, so I suggested we use mock user stories.
