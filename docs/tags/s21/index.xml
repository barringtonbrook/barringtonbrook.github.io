      <description>Introduction Date: 12 Dec 22
Every 2 weeks a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is generated and when this happens we need to update all of our instances with this new AMI. This can be quite a time consuming job so it was decided in a team day towards the end of the year that we would find a way to automate it.
How did we get the ticket? After a brainstorming/whiteboarding session discussing what we wanted out of this piece of work, it was decided that the work would be carried about by me, another apprentice and a fast streamer.</description>
