      <description>Introduction Date: 21 June 23
Article 25 of GDPR (Data protection by design and by default) requires that we &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose&amp;rdquo;
For example, our databases are divided by project and environment (which are called different organisations in mongo) and within these &amp;ldquo;organisations&amp;rdquo; different users have different abilities.
Below you can see evidence of a ticket where I am granting temporary access to another organisation for a user who has sufficient security clearance and a clear use case for accessing this.</description>
