<p>In our team, peer review is an important part of our development process so we can ensure that we maintain a high level of quality for the code we commit since we are continually improving our systems and make a large number of changes in a relatively short space of time.
It is of paramount importance that when reviewing another persons work that we are mindful of the principles of a blameless culture.
This not only fosters a psychologically comfortable context in which people can work it also the right mindset to adopt from a technical point of view.
For example, if a person were to make a breaking change, the focus should not be on what this team member did wrong but how this mistake was not captured by our processes before being able do any damage.</p>
<p>This is an example of a comment I made to highlight what I thought might be unnecessary code, emphasis is on constructive criticism and that I open to allowing the committer to respond that there is a particular reason that they included this:
