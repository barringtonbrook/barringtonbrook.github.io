      <description>Introduction Date: 12 Dec 22
When a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is generated we need to update all of our instances with this new AMI. This can be quite a time consuming job so it was decided in a team day towards the end of the year that we would find a way to automate it. The first ticket for this work was to design and implement a process for refreshing auto-scaling groups in AWS.</description>

      <description>Introduction Date: 27 Jul 22
We were tasked with presenting the work of the Hack team as well as an introduction to DevOps practices and technologies more generally to a non-technical audience.
The Audience was a portfolio team whose interests included our work but who didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have any technical background.
How did we get the ticket? The portfolio team had been conducting a series of meetings where a representative from another team and explained in laymanâ€™s terms how they worked and what it was that they were concerned with.</description>

      <description>Introduction In our repositories the READMEs were often not helpful and contained outdated information. Furthermore, no uniform style was applied. My task was to design and implement an automated process that would remedy this issue.
My solution I decided that I would create a Gitlab CI pipeline to collate information from a number of sources and then create a README and push to the same repository from the Gitlab runner.</description>

      <description>Introduction It had been decided in our organisation that we would migrate our repositories from a self-hosted gitlab instance to a SaaS solution on Gitlab.com. There are a number of benefits to this but mainly you are saving time spent mangaging it. Having a self hosted instance can have some benefits mostly to do with customisation which K24.
