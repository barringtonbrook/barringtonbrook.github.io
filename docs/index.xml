      <description>Introduction Date: 12 Dec 22
When a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is generated we need to update all of our instances with this new AMI. This can be quite a time consuming job so it was decided in a team day towards the end of the year that we would find a way to automate it. The first ticket for this work was to design and implement a process for refreshing auto-scaling groups in AWS.</description>

      <description>Introduction Date: 27 Jul 22
We were tasked with presenting the work of the Hack team as well as an introduction to DevOps practices and technologies more generally to a non-technical audience.
The Audience was a portfolio team whose interests included our work but who didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have any technical background.
How did we get the ticket? The portfolio team had been conducting a series of meetings where a representative from another team and explained in laymanâ€™s terms how they worked and what it was that they were concerned with.</description>

      <description>Introduction Date: 21 Mar 23
It had been decided in our organisation that we would migrate our repositories from a self-hosted gitlab instance to a SaaS solution on Gitlab.com. There are a number of benefits to this but mainly you are saving time spent mangaging it. Having a self hosted instance can have some benefits mostly to do with customisation which K24.
Working with delivery systems. K18.
For this work I adhered to a Plan Do Act Check cycle to ensure I was getting the results I required.</description>

      <description>Introduction Date: 21 Mar 23
Our team provides support to a number of developer teams and every week we select one person to be the main port of call to deal with support requests. On one of my fortnights on support duty, I received a support request that required me to make a support request to Hashicorp, an external organisation that supports a number of our infrastructure tools. The request was do to a developer experiencing unexpected behaviour while using hashicorp nomad.</description>

      <description>Introduction Date: 28 Mar 23
In our team, peer review is an important part of our development process so we can ensure that we maintain a high level of quality for the code we commit since we are continually improving our systems and make a large number of changes in a relatively short space of time. It is of paramount importance that when reviewing anothers work that we are mindful of the principles of a blameless culture.</description>

      <description>Introduction In our repositories the READMEs were often not helpful and contained outdated information. Furthermore, no uniform style was applied. My task was to design and implement an automated process that would remedy this issue.
My solution I decided that I would create a Gitlab CI pipeline to collate information from a number of sources and then create a README and push to the same repository from the Gitlab runner.</description>
