      <description>produces this
Introduction At the end of May we were tasked with decommisioning resources on the legacy AWS accounts. Not only this but to create a documented and repeatable procedure.
After a discussion with the tech lead we decided to use a certain set of buckets to test our procedure. Me and the other apprentice decided to seperate concerns. He would focus on programmatically removing the buckets and I would work on a way of migrating the important data kept within them.</description>

      <description>Introduction We were tasked with presenting the work of the Hack team as well as an introduction to DevOps practices and technologies more generally to a non technical audience. The Audience was a portfolio team whose interest included are work but who didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have any technical background.
The Structure of the Presentation From the beginning I suggested that it might be useful to divide our presentation into two parts. As DevOps practices are largely the result of and reaction to prior working practices in manging IT infrastructure and Ops, I reasoned that our introduction to these practices would not make sense without the added context of what they were replacing.</description>
