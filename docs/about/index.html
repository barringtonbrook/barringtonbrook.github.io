<p>I am a DevOps engineer apprenctice in Hack IT and Whip IT team within Universal Credit, DWP digital.
We are the DevOps team that build and support infrastructure for products and projects on Burbank and UC platforms. We work closely with the Feature Teams in Leeds and Manchester (<strong><a href="/tags/K18">K18</a></strong>).</p>
<p>We are currently using the scrum framework to organise and manage our work. That means we have decide on sprint tickets in week/two week blocks, have daily scrum meetings as well as retrospectives (<strong><a href="/tags/S8">S8</a></strong>).</p>
<h2 id="my-journey-to-becoming-an-apprentice">My Journey to becoming an apprentice</h2>
<p>In 2021, I had been working with one organisation for a number of years and felt like I wanted a change.
I had an interest in computers had written some simple programs. I considered that this interest might offer a potential candidate for the career change I had been searching for.
After looking on the internet, I came across this apprenticeship and I thought that being able to learn while studying would be an invaluable opportunity, so I promptly applied.</p>
<h2 id="universal-credit">Universal Credit</h2>
<h2 id="dwp-digital">DWP digital</h2>
<p>the DWP UK’s largest public service department and thus manages one of the most complex IT systems in western europe with 7.35 million benefit claims each year, paying £165 billion in benefits and pensions.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-navigate-this-portfolio">How to navigate this portfolio</h2>
<p>This website is divided into three sections. This is the about section. The home section will take you to a list of projects I have worked on with the relevent KSBs linked underneath.
If you click on any of these it will take you to a page that shows all projecs with the same KSBs.
If you click on the KSBs link at the top, you will see a list of all KSBs that display all of the projects that demonstrate their requirements.
Each stage is on its own branch in the github repo for <strong><a href="https://github.com/barringtonbrook/barringtonbrook.github.io">this site.</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="training-completed">Training completed</h2>
<p>In line with Health and Safety legislation, I completed a short online course that instructed me how to to minimise risk to my person as much as possible in the course of my duties (<strong><a href="/tags/K22">K22</a></strong>).</p>
