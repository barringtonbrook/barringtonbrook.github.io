## Introduction

***Date:** 24 Jan 23*

The Describe It! workshop started as way for people within the organisation to hone their presenting and whiteboarding skills in front of an audience and recieve both technical and nontechnical feedback.

### What was the situation?

### The team

## My presentation

I decided in my presentation to speak about Docker and containerisation in general.

I split my talk into three sections: what is docker? how it worked under the hood and why it was a fundamentally different solution from using virtual machines despite the shared goal of process isolation and finally how it is used.

For the second task I had to speak about Continuous Integration and its benefits.
