## Introduction

***Date:** 21 Mar 23*

Our team provides support to a number of developer teams and every week we select one person to be the main port of call to deal with support requests.
On one of my fortnights on support duty, I received a support request that required me to make a support request to Hashicorp, an external organisation that supports a number of our infrastructure tools.
The request was do to a developer experiencing unexpected behaviour while using hashicorp nomad.
I had to log the request on hashicorps support page (communicating in an asynchronous, low bandwith manner  **[K19](/tags/k19)**) and act as an intermediary between the developer and Hashicorp.

Ultimately we managed to resolve the issue after doing some tests and finding the program was working as intended but confusing and missing documentation had lead us to have different expectations.
