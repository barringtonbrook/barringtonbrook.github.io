## My Team

I am a DevOps engineer apprenctice in Hack IT and Whip IT team within Universal Credit, DWP digital.
We are the DevOps team that build and support infrastructure for products and projects on Burbank and UC platforms. We work closely with the Feature Teams in Leeds and Manchester (**[K18](/tags/K18)**).

We are currently using the scrum framework to organise and manage our work. That means we have decide on sprint tickets in week/two week blocks, have daily scrum meetings as well as retrospectives (**[S8](/tags/S8)**).

We are a generally supportive team and endevour to share knowledge as much as possible. For example, a new apprentice joined the team recently and didn't have much experience in writing bash scripts so I said to him that I would assign him a ticket and pair with him on it. I was able to share, not only my knowledge of bash scripting but also my workflow and things that he could try. (**[S4](/tags/S4)**)

## My Journey to becoming an apprentice

In 2021, I had been working with one organisation for a number of years and felt like I wanted a change.
I had an interest in computers had written some simple programs. I considered that this interest might offer a potential candidate for the career change I had been searching for.
After looking on the internet, I came across this apprenticeship and I thought that being able to learn while studying would be an invaluable opportunity, so I promptly applied.
